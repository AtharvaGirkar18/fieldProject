  "about": "They are the children of jobless parents under tremendous social pressure. Their lives lack structure and are torn apart by superstitions. These children have parents crushed by money lenders and debt, and the social system does not recognize their existence. Their health needs are neglected, and they face a bleak future, living only for today. Their family lives are disturbed, and they are shunned by the so-called elite of society. These children endure harsh and adverse conditions. The Vasti Vikas Prakalp strives to bring such children into the mainstream of society by addressing not only their educational needs but also their health and emotional well-being.",
